  <div id="lessonsFromJesus"><p>The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) - A story about a rebellious younger son, a forgiving father, and an indignant older son. Teaches about forgiveness, repentance, and God's love for sinners.
    The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) - A man is robbed and left for dead. The only one to help is a Samaritan, considered an outsider. Lesson is to love your neighbor as yourself and show mercy.
    The Lost Sheep (Luke 15:1-7) - A shepherd leaves his 99 sheep to find one that is lost. God rejoices over even one sinner who repents.
    The Mustard Seed (Mark 4:30-32) - The kingdom of God grows from small beginnings, just as a mustard seed grows into a large bush.
    The Sower and the Seed (Mark 4:1-20) - A sower scatters seed, which falls on different types of soil, representing how people respond to God's Word.
    The Widow's Offering (Mark 12:41-44) - Though poor, a widow's small offering meant more than the large gifts of the rich. It's the spirit that counts.
    The Workers in the Vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16) - Laborers who worked longer resented that latecomers were paid the same. But the landowner can be generous.
    The Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18:21-35) - A servant is forgiven much debt but then refuses to forgive a smaller debt of another. We must forgive others.
    The Ten Virgins (Matthew 25:1-13) - Five virgins who are prepared go to the wedding feast, while five who are unprepared are left out. We must be ready.</p></div>

    <p>In summary, here is what we know of the life of Jesus Christ: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Birth: Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit and born to the virgin Mary in Bethlehem around 4-6 BC (Luke 2:1-7). His birth fulfilled Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah. </li>  
      <li>Early life: Jesus grew up in Nazareth in Galilee. At age 12, he impressed the teachers in the temple courts with his wisdom (Luke 2:41-52). Aside from this, the Bible does not record anything else about his childhood. </li>  
      <li>Ministry: Jesus began his public ministry around age 30 after being baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. He taught extensively throughout Galilee, gathered disciples, and performed many miracles of healing and deliverance (Mark 1:14-39). </li> 
      <li>Teachings: Jesus taught people to love God and love their neighbor. He emphasized mercy, forgiveness, humility, and putting others first. He often taught in parables and metaphor. He also provoked the religious leaders by healing on the Sabbath and associating with sinners.</li>  
      <li>Miracles: Jesus performed many miracles, including turning water into wine, feeding the five thousand, walking on water, and raising Lazarus from the dead. This demonstrated his divinity and power over nature, sickness, and death.</li>   
      <li>Death: Jesus was betrayed by Judas and arrested by the religious authorities who condemned him to death for blasphemy. He was crucified under Pontius Pilate around 30 AD despite being innocent (Matthew 27). His crucifixion fulfilled Isaiah 53 and other prophecies about the Messiah's suffering. </li>  
      <li>Resurrection: On the third day after his death, Jesus miraculously rose from the dead and appeared to his disciples. His resurrection authenticated his claims to divinity and paved the way for the spread of Christianity (Luke 24). </li>
    </ul>  
    <p>So in summary, Jesus lived a life marked by miraculous birth, dynamic public ministry, profound teachings, shocking death on a cross, and an unprecedented resurrection from death. This life is the subject of the four gospel biographies in the New Testament.</p>
