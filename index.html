        <p>Jesus' message is a call to place our complete trust and faith in him for salvation and freedom from sin. Out of gratitude for his sacrificial love and forgiveness, we love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength. On earth we express our love for God by loving one another. Following the life of Jesus, we are to forgive our enemies, care compassionately for the poor and marginalized, and serve our neighbors with humility and generosity. When we center our lives on Jesus' teachings and example, we find our purpose: to join his mission to spread redeeming love in the world.</p>

    <h2>Life, Death, & Resurrection</h2>

      <p>Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit and born to the virgin Mary in Bethlehem around 4-6 BC (Luke 2:1-7). His birth fulfilled Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah. After being warned in a dream of king Herod's plan to kill the child, Joseph took Mary and Jesus to Egypt to escape.</p>  
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KYn7705w/nazareth-israel.jpg" alt="painting-first-century-nazareth">
      <p>Once king Herod died, they settled in Nazareth in Galilee where Jesus grew up.

      <p>Jesus and his parents Mary and Joseph traveled to Jerusalem for the Passover festival when he was 12 years old. After the celebration, Mary and Joseph started the journey home but Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem without them knowing it. After a day of travel, they realized Jesus was missing and returned to Jerusalem to find him. After three days, they found Jesus sitting among the teachers in the temple, listening to them and asking insightful questions. The people there were amazed at his understanding and answers. When Mary told Jesus they had been worried, Jesus replied “Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”</p>
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/hv73BLnB/Baptism-of-Christ.jpg" alt="baptism-of-jesus">  
      <p>Jesus began his public ministry around age 30 after being baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. He taught extensively throughout Galilee, gathered disciples, and performed many miracles of healing and deliverance (Mark 1:14-39). </p> 
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/P58fRc93/bloch-sermon-on-the-mount815x912.jpg" alt="jesus-preaching-sermon-at-the-mount">
      <p>He taught people to love God and love their neighbor. He emphasized mercy, forgiveness, humility, and putting others first. He often taught in parables and metaphor. He also provoked the religious leaders by healing on the Sabbath and associating with sinners.</p>  
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Gp7LfCzy/FW0i-Bmp-Xg-AEje-Fr.jpg" alt="raising-lazarus-from-the-dead">
      <p>He performed many miracles, including turning water into wine, feeding the five thousand, walking on water, and raising Lazarus from the dead. This proved his divinity and power over nature, sickness, and death.</p>

      <p class="contains-link">Jesus was betrayed by Judas and arrested by the religious authorities who condemned him to death for blasphemy. He was <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/03/jesus-christ-the-anatomical-and-physiological-details-of-6-hours-of-pain-and-death-by-crucifixion/#:~:text=Within%20minutes%20of%20crucifixion%20Jesus,His%20dislocated%20elbows%20and%20shoulders." target="_blank">crucified</a> under Pontius Pilate around 30 AD despite being innocent (Matthew 27). His crucifixion fulfilled Isaiah 53 and other prophecies about the Messiah's suffering. </p>

      <p>On the third day after his death, Jesus miraculously rose from the dead and appeared to his disciples. His resurrection authenticated his claims to divinity and paved the way for the spread of Christianity (Luke 24). </p>

      <p>40 days after Jesus' resurrection he was taken up into heaven. According to Acts 1:9-11, after speaking with his disciples one last time on the Mount of Olives, Jesus was lifted up and a cloud hid him from their sight. Two men in white appeared and told the disciples Jesus had been taken into heaven and would return again one day in the same way. The ascension marked the end of Jesus' earthly ministry and his exaltation to the right hand of God.  It is remembered and celebrated by Christians today as part of Jesus' life and victory over death.</p>
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ryRMk9W0/pentecost-jen-norton.jpg" alt="pentecost">
      <p>On the day of Pentecost, 50 days after Easter, the disciples were gathered together in Jerusalem when they were filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other tongues/languages. Many people were in Jerusalem for the festival and heard the disciples preaching about Jesus in their own native languages. This miraculous sign of the Holy Spirit enabled the disciples to begin preaching the gospel with boldness.</p>
